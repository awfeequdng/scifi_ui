# scifi_ui

An exploration of what cool-looking science-fiction UI elements are possible
with Flutter.

**Note:** This repo is a playground. No claims on whether such a UI is actually good for the user.
Also, the code is solely focused on pushing pixels, with no regard to readability or performance.
